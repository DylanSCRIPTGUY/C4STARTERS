    <h1>THE SYNTAX OF C:</h1>
    <p>C's syntax is straightforward.
      For functions, they begin with the function name followed by parentheses.
      If there are any parameters, they are specified within these parentheses.
      The function block concludes with a semicolon.
      <br>
      For conditionals, the structure starts with the conditional statement,
      followed by parentheses containing parameters if applicable. The block of code associated with the conditional is enclosed in curly brackets.
      <br>
      And finally, statements in C start with the statement, and (if there are any), the paremeters will be put after (NOT IN PARENTHESIS) and a semicolon at the end.
    </p>
    <p>Function:</p>
    <p style="color:blue;">afunction(parameters);</p>
    <p>Conditional:</p>
    <p style="color:blue;">if(1 == 1) {<br>    return 1;<br>}</p>
    <p>Statement:</p>
    <p style="color:blue;">return 0;</p>
    <h1>COMMENTS:</h1>
    <p>The first thing that I am going to do is display a comment. A comment is ignored by the compiler
      and is essentially an area for notes. you can make a comment by typing "//" and then your text.
    </p>
    <p style="color:blue;">// This is a comment. It is ignored by the compiler. You can write notes here</p>

    <h1>PRINTING TEXT:</h1>
    <p>Printing text is very simple. To print text, use the "printf()" function</p>
    <p style="color:blue;">printf("this is the text!\n")</p>
    <p>notice that at the end I added "\n" to it. This prints a new line. This is essential
      to prevent visual bugs. Although there are some scenarios where you can avoid it.</p>

    <h1>STARTING AND ENDING A PROGRAM:</h1>
    <p>To start and end a program, you use "int main()" and "return 0;"</p>
    <p>This program prints hello world and then closes:</p>
    <script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDylanSCRIPTGUY%2FC4STARTERS%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fprintf.c&style=a11y-light&type=code"></script>

    <h1>Compiling & running code:</h1>
    <p>Now, lets try and test the following hello world code that we made. But how do we run it? We use compilers.
      They get our code and turn it into an executable. There are many options, but I will use gcc as it is very easy
      to use. to test your code, open your terminal. From there, locate the folder that you put your code into.
      After that, type this into your terminal:</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:blue;">gcc -o nameofyourprogram nameofthecfile.c</p>
    <p>after this, you should be left with an executable. And if you run it, it should print "hello world"</p>
    <p>(If you want to automate this process. Use Makefiles. But I will not be making a tutorial for Makefiles)</p>
